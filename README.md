### Enforcing constraints on neural networks output with gradient steps

Seminar project in which I reproduced the below cited work method,
this repository provides a framework and some experiments with this inference 
technique examined on the Semantic Role Labeling task which is an NLP sequence tagging problem.
Code is written using Python 3.6 with the aid of AllenNLP and PyTorch libraries.
